# MOMO

MOMO is my love letter to the commuters of Queens, NY. In the city, people are constantly on the run and so are their minds. I wanted to take advanatge of the limited internet connection underground, when you can't doom scroll, and provide users with a simple self-care tool. I purposefully designed the app so that users can engage in wellness exercises that can be done in small public spaces like the subway. 

Queens is the most diverse place in the world. So, it was very important to me to provide language options and to make it as user-friendly as possible for those who may not be the most technologically savvy/experienced. This is an app for all but especially those who might only have time to themselves during their commute.

MOMO sessions use sound frequency to encourage your nervous system to calm down. To begin a session, all you have to do is answer 2 simple questions. That's also the only time you're ever required to look at the screen. After starting your session, there are optional breathing and reflexology exercises that can also be done. Options are purposefully limited since it's encouraged to give your eyes a break! 

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React-Native, 

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
