# MOMO

MOMO is an app for everyone but it was especially designed for the commuters of Queens, NY. Commuters are always on the go. For some people, the only time they have to themselves is when they're underground in the subway. I wanted to take advantage of those moments, when there is limited to no internet connection, and provide a simple self-care tool that could be used in small public spaces like the subway or bus.

MOMO sessions use sound frequencies to soothe your nervous system. To begin a session, all you have to do is answer 2 simple questions. That's also the only time you're ever really required to look at the screen. After starting your session, there are optional breathing and reflexology exercises that can also be done. Nearly all exercises can be comfortably done without disturbing the person right next to you (subway & bus friendly).
